# python-challenge

The code used in the two parts of this challenge comes again from a variety of concepts that instructor Bipin presented to us through out Week 3. In day two of instruction he covered how to input and read in a CSV file which was essential to the assignment at hand, exersise 10-Ins_WriteCSV, specifically. A great deal of the PyBank and PyPoll code was derived and manipulated from 12-StuCensusZip exercise where we learned to append rows rows and actually output results from analysis. I again sought guidance from Stack Overflow as well as YouTube, outside of course notes, and actually confering with Instructor Karunakaran for help with getting my terminal on the correct filepath.
